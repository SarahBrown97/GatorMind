This project uses Zoom SDK for peer-support implementation. Once you download the repo from github, extract it, 
then follow this link to import 2 modules named commonlib and mobilertc into the project application.

To import the 2 modules, first we need to download the zoom-sdk for android from here - [a link](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-sdk-android/archive/master.zip)
Then, unzip the file and follow the steps [a link](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/native-sdks/android/getting-started/integration)
to import the 2 commonlib and mobilertc AAR Packages to the app.

All the dependencies and configurations are already present, all we need to do is import the above mentioned AAR packages and then build the project and run.
